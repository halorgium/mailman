# Mailman

Mailman is an incoming mail processing microframework (with POP3 and Maildir
support), that works with Rails "out of the box".

    require 'mailman'
    Mailman::Application.run do
      to 'ticket-%id%@example.org' doâ€¨
        Ticket.find(params[:id]).add_reply(message)
      end
    end

See the {file:USER_GUIDE.md} for more information.
